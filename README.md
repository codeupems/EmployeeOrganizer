<ul>
This is a system to look up employees 
from a large database and obtain certain 
information based on a user's credentials.
<li>

    User must be logged in in order to access the system.

    Registering a User will require an employee "id" number so 
    the possible employee signing up will need an employee id
    to be verified if they wish to register and log in.
